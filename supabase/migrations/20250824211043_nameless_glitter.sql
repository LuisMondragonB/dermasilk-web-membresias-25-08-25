  # Fix RLS policy for clients table

  1. Security Changes
    - Enable RLS on clients table if not already enabled
    - Add policy to allow all operations for authenticated users
    - Add policy to allow all operations for anon users (for admin functionality)

  2. Notes
    - This allows the admin panel to create, read, update, and delete clients
    - Uses both authenticated and anon roles for maximum compatibility

-- Drop existing policies if they exist to avoid conflicts

-- Create comprehensive policy for all operations
